12/16/2019 - Starting "Using Items" (inventory works, can't use the items themselves yet)
http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python3%2Blibtcod,_part_8

(I've skipped Save and Load, can't download SHELVE, so can't test it rn. Dungeon_level needs including (from next step) in saving/loading module too)

STOPPED: Testing random choice function in monster, item population. About to start: "Monster and item progression"
